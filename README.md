### Abstract

The following rules and regulations govern the archery event of HuroCup, a robotic game and robotics benchmark problem for humanoid robots. 

###Latest Version of the Rules for HuroCup

The latest official version of the rules of the game for HuroCup is always available from the [HuroCup Facebook Page](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.facebook.com/groups/hurocup&sa=D&ust=1513944124144000&usg=AFQjCNE3Jn_vwDht-c_0L6AVwqKhTOTnIA).

###Archery

The goal of the archery competition is to encourage research into humanoid robots that are able to do compliant control precisely.

###HuroCup Archery - Laws of the Game

The following laws describe the specifics of the archery event. For general specifications relevant to all HuroCup events (e.g., robot dimensions, playing field and lighting, responsibility of the referees) please refer to[ General - HuroCup Laws of the Game](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/15laUlB6uZ56J5WpGPhepb7P8O7ul-8K5sgdf4uwu4Ak/pub&sa=D&ust=1513944124145000&usg=AFQjCNHBdXJqLQd3lZfpQXpL9q5Qpbu4rA)

[A-1.1]: The dimensions of the playing field are at least 400 cm by  300 cm. On one end of the playing field a target board is hanged up.  This end is called the target board side. The opposite side of the playing field is called the shooting side. See [ HuroCup Archery field](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vw3d7PTQD5_KZzCgdRNJrrkNQ9bXQGFf2iCc136tKdo/pub#kix.berij2q8ubgk)  for more details.

[A-1.2]: The target board is separated into three circles in different color.  The robot shooting arrow at different circles gets different score points.

[A-1.3]: On the target board, three circles from inside to outside are 5, 3 and 1 score points, respectively.  For example, the yellow circle is 3-point zone.

[A-1.4]: The target board is soft material.  The arrows that the team prepare must be not too sharp.  For competition safety, the referees have right to ask teams to replace their arrows.

[A-1.5]: The rectangular area enclosed by white lines is the start zone.  The robot must shoot in the start zone.

[A-1.6]:During shooting, the robot is not allowed to go outside of  the white lines of the rectangular area.

###[A-3]: Number of Robots

[A-3.1]: A single robot competes in a match.

###[A-4]: The Players

[A-7.1]: One robot is designated the shooter. All other robots must be positioned well away from the side of target board and must not interfere with the shooter in any way.

[A-7.3]: The human handlers must not interfere in any way with other robots, the referee, or other human handlers.

[A-7.5]: At the beginning of the shooting, the shooter robot must face the target board and be directly behind the white line at a random start point.

[A-7.6]: After the shooter has been placed, the referee will select a random position inside of the start zone.  The shooter shooting out of the start zone cannot get any score point.

1. the arrow prodded on the target board after being shot by the shooter,

2. the robot angle between the bow and the target is greater than 45 degrees or the bow and arrow is aimed in such a way that it may hit other spectators or participants,

3. he maximum duration of the competition (2 minutes) has elapsed,

4. the robot damages holder, or playing field,

5. the arrow moved outside of the playing field, or dropped down on the ground,

###[A-8]: Method of Scoring

[A-8.1]: There are five rounds in the competition.

[A-8.2]: A robot scores if the arrow prods on the target board.  The score points got by the robot are dependent on the arrow prodded the position of the target point.  For example, if the arrow is prodded at 5-point circle, then the robot get 5 points.

[A-8.3]: Any robot that has not scored a single point is automatically awarded 0 rank.

[A-8.4]: Among the robots that have scored at least one point, the robots are ranked (i.e., 1st place, 2nd place) based on the greater number of points that the robot scored.

[A-8.5]: For more details about the point allocation, please refer to  [Point Allocation [Organization - HuroCup Laws of the Game]](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kn2_dtNp65n1j5TjZWJVIlTKRFcNkTSpARkdhLHNA1c/edit%23bookmark%3Did.rzzlothp76e9&sa=D&ust=1513944124157000&usg=AFQjCNGobLAXBZYRJKSOR0OszEQAnfBkRw).

###[A-9]: Tiebreaker

[A-9.1]: In case of a tie, i.e., more than one robot having scored the same number of points, the robots will be ranked based on the sum of their score point over all rounds.

[A-9.2]: In case one or more robots have scored the same number of points and are still tied after applying the previous tiebreaker, the maximum score points in a single round will be used to break the tie.
